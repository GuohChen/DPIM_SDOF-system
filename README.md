# DPIM_SDOF-system
Direct probability integral method (DPIM) is a unified framework for uncertainty propagation analysis, reliability analysis and reliability-based optimization design for static or dynamic structural systems, which is based on the probability density integral equations (PDIEs) from the principle of conservation of probability. 
 
DPIM_SDOF.m is for stochastic response analysis of SDOF system using DPIM;
SelectPoint_GF.m is for generating the representative point set (integration points) and calculating assigned probability (integration weight), so as to solve the probability density integral equation (PDIE) based on GF-discrepancy point selection technique.
